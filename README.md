This project implements a real-time chat application using Socket.io, Express, and Mongoose for the backend, and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, fetch, and jQuery for the frontend.  It features user authentication (signup and login), room-based chat, message persistence using MongoDB, and a typing indicator.  Users can join and leave predefined chat rooms, send messages within their chosen room, and their chat history is saved.
